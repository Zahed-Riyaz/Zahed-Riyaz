# Hi there, I'm Zahed 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Physics major who is deeply interested in ML-based computer simulations and studying high energy physics (Quantum Field Theory).

I'm a passionate about Deep Learning with a keen interest in Quantum Deep Learning. Feel free to explore my repositories and contribute if you find something interesting!

## 🚀 About Me

- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
    - **Geometric Deep Learning** Equivariances and Symmetries in Machine Learning
    - **Quantum Machine Learning** Equivariant QNNs, QML algorithms
    - **Computer Vision** Applying Neural Networks to study microstructure grain growth
    - **LLMs** RAG reliant ML applications built using Django
    - **Container Networking** : Currently learning about Kubernetes to deploy applications based on personal ideas.
## 🛠️ Skills

- **Subjects** : Quantum Physics and Deep Learning are my passion.
- **Frameworks/Technologies:** Very familiar with PyTorch and Tensorflow. Have built several beginner projects.
- **Tools:** Familiar with containerisation of applications, currently learning networking and kubernetes.


Thanks for visiting, and feel free to open an issue or pull request if you'd like to collaborate!
